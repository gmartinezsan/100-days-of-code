# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the exercises suggeted at https://www.lynda.com/Software-Development-tutorials/Review-string-Python/576698/605460-4.html?org=oracle.com

**Thoughts** I've reviewed some  basics examples from the course to keep it simple.
-- Did the Following exercises:
    - Get the second largest element in an array of numbers
    - Determine if a string is the reverse of another string, asume both are the same length
    - Given two strings determine if arg1 is greater that arg2. Do not use the int class or convert the strings to numbers.

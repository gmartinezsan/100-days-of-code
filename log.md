# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the exercises suggeted at https://www.lynda.com/Software-Development-tutorials/Review-string-Python/576698/605460-4.html

**Thoughts** I've reviewed some  basics examples from the course to keep it simple.
-- Did the Following exercises:
    - Get the second largest element in an array of numbers
    - Determine if a string is the reverse of another string, asume both are the same length
    - Given two strings determine if arg1 is greater that arg2. Do not use the int class or convert the strings to numbers.

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the exercises suggeted at https://www.lynda.com/Software-Development-tutorials/Practice-problems-2D-array/576698/605467-4.html about two dimensional arrays.

**Thoughts** 
-- Did the following operations with 2D arrays
   - Different ways to declare and initialize 2D arrays
   - Iterate over all the elements
   - Resolve an exercise: 
Given a two dimensional array that represent a chessboard find the answer to the question if rooks are safe and if that's the case you should return true or false other wise. The configuration of the board will be given as an input to your function and it'll be represented as a two dimensional array. Zero means that there's nothing in that space, and one means that there's a rook there. in this case a 4x4 chessboard, the array cannot be empty, but a smallest 1x1 is also a valid board. Call this method AreRooksSafe.
